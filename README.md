# Employee Management System
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Python-based application with a Streamlit-powered web interface, designed to manage employee records efficiently. It provides a full suite of CRUD operations and integrates with a robust backend API built using FastAPI.

### System Architecture
- Streamlit provides a responsive web interface
- FastAPI exposes REST endpoints for CRUD operations
- PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and fast queries

### Features and Functionalities
The system includes the following features:
1. **User Authentication**
    - Secure login interface
    - Role-based access control (Admin, User)

### User Interface
>> TODO


### Getting Started (Windows)
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
2. Clone the repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/Merci93/Employee-Management-System
cd Employee-Management-System
````

3. Run the setup batch script:
````
.\setup.bat
````

The batch script will:
    - Build the Docker image (if not already built)
    - Start Docker containers via docker-compose
    - Activate the virtual environment
    - Launch the EMS Streamlit UI


No manual virtual environment setup or Python commands are needed â€” everything is handled by setup.bat
